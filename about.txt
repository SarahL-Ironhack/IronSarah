My name is Sarah

I live in Paris
I am currently unemployed but used to work as a sales manager in the education field
I have experience trying to analyse sales results and forecasting using Excel

I would like to become a data analyst, but first start off as a Sales performance analyst to do a smooth transition (and not lose too much on my salary with a junior DA position) 

Found IronHack thanks to Pole-Emploi
I expect to learn how to use tools related to DA and analytics

I will apply to sales performance analyst jobs 

No preference regarding the industry
Future role should be a link between Data and business. Being a help to management and decision makers thanks to Data.
Getting a top management role in a nice company.
