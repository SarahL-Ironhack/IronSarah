7. Take a look at the data you retrieved in question 5. Give some insights.
Most rated apps are a mix of games, social networks and lifestyle/health/religion apps. 

8. Take a look at the data you retrieved in question 6. Give some insights.
All are noted 5 out of 5, less games than in the most rated. These are more "usefull" apps such as TurboScan Pro, Domino's or a calendar. Best rated doesn't mean most rated, One five point rate is enough to make it to the short list but does not guarantee the quality of the app. 

9. Now compare the data from questions 5 and 6. What do you see?
Most rated apps are not the best rated (non in common). More rates = more possibility to have some unsatisfied customers which will inevitably tend to a rate a little under 5, even for very good rated apps. 

10. How could you take the top 3 regarding both user ratings and number of votes?
Plants vs. Zombies	5	426463
Domino's Pizza USA	5	258624
Plants vs. Zombies HD	5	163598

11. Do people care about the price of an app? Do some queries, comment why are you doing them and the results you retrieve. What is your conclusion?
Most expensive app costs $250 and still has a rate of 4 . It also has 773 ratings so it is a used app. 
The most rated apps (most rating being 2974676) are however free. The difference between the number of ratings of free apps vs. most expensive apps shows people do care about the price, but the rating indicates it has not been impacted by the price. 
However there seems to be an impact on the app downloading once you reach $10 since the number of rating top at 2500 ratings for a $20 app vs. 40000 for a $10 app.
