UNDERSTANDING CODE - Ana Cortes

https://github.com/akcortes/IronAna/blob/main/Second_Project/Project%202.ipynb 

Workflow :
import necessary libraries 
use .info to find relevant codes to be used for the project and search using keyword 'energy'
creating a table with the needed information (country, year, values) 
Other source of information : climatewatchdata scrapped to get more information


Useful knowledge: 
use of "parsed" and appending a new list with the information we are willing to work on 


Could be improved :
- too many useless libraries imported to start with 
- array = [] not usefull
- didn't understand last part of the code (second API)
