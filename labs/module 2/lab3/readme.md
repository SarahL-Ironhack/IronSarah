PART 1 
Challenge 1 :
Find a and b, if median=42, mean=50
20,34, 34,  12, 56, 110, 49, a, b.
A = 42
B = 93

Challenge 2 : 
A car hit an average speed of v1 = 60 kmph in the first half of the journey, and hit an average speed of v2 = 110 kmph in the second half of the journey. Determine the average speed of the car.

(v1 + v2)/2 = 170/2 = 85kmph average

Challenge 3: 
240 + ((480 - 399) / 200)x (304-240) = approx. 266 
266 / 400 = 0.665 so 66.6% 

Challenge 4: 
Mean = (9.5x16 + 29.5x13 + 49.5x17 + 69.5x4 + 89.5x4 + 109.5x3+ 129.5 + 149.5 + 169.5) / 60  = 46.5mn 

median = 40 + ((60/2)-29)/17) x 19 = 41.11 

standard deviation = (16x(9.5-46.5)² + 13x(29.5-46.5)² + 17x(49.5-46.5)² + 4x(69.5-46.5)² + 4x(89.5-46.5)² + 3x(109.5-46.5)² + (129.5-46.5)² + (149.4-46.5)² + (169.5-46.5)²)/60
std = approx 33

PART 2
Challenge 1:

A. P(D1) = 2/6 of having a number greater than 5 (including 5)
P(D2= 2/6 of having a number greater than 5 (including 5)
P(D1UD2) = P(D1) x P(D2) = 4/36 = 1/9

B. For even sum: , Twice: 1+3, 1+5,  2+4, 2+6, 3+5, 4+6, Once: 1+1, 2+2,3+3, 4+4, 5+5, 6+6 
18 possibilities out of 36 in total = 18/36 = 1/2 

C. Probability of having a 6 on both dice = 1/6 of having a 6 on each die so 1/6 x 1/6 = 1/36 

Challenge 2: 

A. Total cards = 52 
Total figures = 4x4 = 16 
P(F1) = 16/52 
P(F2) = 15/51 - assuming the first card picked is already a figure so the players continues to pick, hoping to have a second figure
P(F1 & F2) = 16/52x15/51 = 240/2652 = 20/221 or 9% chance of picking two figures

B. possibilities : 10(or figure) + 7, 9+8
(P10then7) = 16/52 x 4/51 = 2,4%
P(7then10) = 4/52 x 16/51 = 2,4%
P(9&8) = 4/52 x 4/51 = 0,60%
Total =  3,4 % 

C. P1 = 8x4 = 32/ 52 , P2 = 31/51,  (P1UP2) = 992/2652 = 248/663

Challenge 3:

A. P(D2) = 1/6 

B. P(A)<=2 = 2/6
P(B)<=2 = 2/6
P(A)UP(B)= 2/6x2/6 = 4/36 = 1/9 = 

C. P(Awins4) : winning at least 4 coins possibilities = 5 vs 1 /or/ 6 vs 2 /or/ 6 vs 1 // total possibilities = 6x6 = 36
P(Awins4) = 3/36 = 1/12 = 8,3%
P(Aloses2) : losing at least 2 coins possibilities = 1 vs 3,4,5,6 /or/ 2 vs 4,5,6 /or/ 3 vs 5,6 /or/ 4 vs6 = 10 possibilities
P(Aloses2) = 10/36 = 5/18 = 27,8%
P(draw) = 6/36 = 1/6 = 16,7%
