# Did Donald Trump Use Artificial Intelligence to Win the Election?

**Supervised learning** : basic information is given (what is a Trump supporter/what is a Clinton supporter) , and then target one or the other and ignore those who are not interesting .
1. Personalities analyzis to target potential trump supporters, then target them with enhanced ads or news they were the only ones to see
2. They analyzed and tracked social media presence, enhanced the messages, using bots,  that fit them (either helping Trump getting elected, or convincing Clinton supporters not to vote for her). Giving more visibility to these messages using bots enabled them to have better control on the message (better than with human trolls)
3. They also used geographical location to target specific states (such as swing states) where Trump would later go.
